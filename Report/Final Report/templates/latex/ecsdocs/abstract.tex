My project will be a smart contract builder that allows a founder to create a decentralised sports club. This will use the blockchain to provide a trustless environment to collect and allocate money.  It will also use multi agent system algorithms to speed up and rationalise the method of choosing representatives and deciding budgets. By combining multi agent systems and blockchain, users will be able to agree to the algorithms before hand and trust that they will be carried out accurately. The project will also look at the cost of running the algorithms and make sure it can scale with the number of representatives and users. 
\\
The project will also come with an example web interface that allows users to interact with the block chain without a terminal
