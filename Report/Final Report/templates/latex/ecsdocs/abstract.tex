My project will be a smart contract builder that allows a founder to create a decentralised sports club. This will use the Ethereum blockchain to provide a trustless environment to collect and allocate money.  It will also use multi-agent system algorithms, to speed up and rationalise the method of choosing representatives, and to decide budgets. By combining multi-agent systems and blockchain, users will be able to agree to the algorithms beforehand and trust that they will be carried out accurately. The project will also look at the cost of running the algorithms and make sure it can scale with the number of representatives and users. \\
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, which allows users to upload smart contracts to the network. Other users can then send transactions to the smart contract. These transactions are validated by miners in return for a miners fee; a certain amount of Ethereum. The miners then run the transaction and update the storage of the smart contract.\\
The project will also come with an example web interface that allows users to interact with the block chain without a terminal.
