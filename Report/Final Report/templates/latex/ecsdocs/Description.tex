My project will be a smart contract builder that allows a founder to create a decentralised sports club. This will allow the founder to set some of the initial parameters. These include number of representatives, number of sinks, cost to register, length of terms etc. Once this is set up on an address, prospective members will be able to register to the club by sending the required Ethereum to the address. Every budgeting term, members will vote for a representative, whoâ€™s weight will be determined by the number of people of voted for them. If the number of users is small enough, the contract could be set to direct democracy mode where each user represents himself with one weight, however this would cost more gas to run the negotiation algorithm. Once all representatives are chosen, they must agree on several places they believe money should be used and the people (their addresses), who subsequently, will use the money. They then will each submit their optimal budget of how they believe the collected money should be spent. The negotiation algorithm is then run, until a majority of the representatives weight agree on a budget. \\ I will also create an interface for my contract, so that users do not have to work out how to send data and Ethereum to contracts. There will also be messsge boards, enabling canvassing for votes and sink ideas can be discussed. The interface should also be able to monitor and track the state of the clubs finances to be able to confirm that money is being spent correctly.
