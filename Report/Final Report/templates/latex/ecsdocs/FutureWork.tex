One problem with my current system, is the html interface, although functional and more accessible than the command line, is still very basic and is not easy to use. \\
Another part to add to the system is the ability to raise and distribute money during the year with a subset of users e.g some players in the team are going to a tournament. Now all money is raised at the start of the year by everyone and then distributed to managers. \\
Another addition would be a way to monitor the managers of the sinks. Instead of the all the money being sent to the managers, managers would have to start a vote (maybe only among representatives), and ask for a certain amount of money for some task. At the moment managers could get the money at the start of the year and just leave. \\
Another problem is that users are all cleared at the end of the term, and then they can register again for the next year. This is a problem as gas is wasted deleting then storing their address and name again. This could be solved with a reregister function. \\
Also if the second order Copeland algorithm or my budgeting algorithm can be verified in less time than it takes to solve, then the system can scale much better and use a lot less gas. Then users read the input, solve it on their computers, and upload the correct result to the smart contract. The smart contract can then verify the result and if it passes, set the result. However I do not know if this is possible for either of the algorithms
