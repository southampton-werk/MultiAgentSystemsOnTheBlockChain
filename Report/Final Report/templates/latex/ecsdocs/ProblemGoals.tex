\section{Problem}
Most university clubs collect registration fees to finance their activities for the year. The current solution for collecting the fees is either with cash or online. Both have the problem that the money is collected by one entity, and cash has the added negative that the payment could be repudiated. Then at the annual general meeting  (AGM) , members vote for representatives and for managers. The problem with this is that the AGM is often held before the start of semester one, this means that many members and first years, who are a large proportion of the club members, are unable to vote. 
\\
After representatives and managers are chosen, they decide on several places the budget can be spent and how much money each of those places get. The disadvantage with this is that deciding where the money should go can take long time. Another problem with the negotiation phase is that quiet individuals may be bullied into making concessions by someone more confident. Lastly the final budget may not be known by normal members, making it unaccountable and opaque.
\section{Goals}
For the collection of the fees, I want my solution to have these characteristics. First off, all registrations are non repudiable. This means that there is a method for confirming the user has paid the fee. Also we can check the authenticity of a registration. This means that we a user can identify himself as the one who paid the registration. Another feature is transparency, everyone should be able to see how much money has been collected from fees. Lastly until the budget has been decided no one should be able to access the money.
\\
For the voting, the features are as follows. First off all members who have paid their registration fees should have equal voting power and the ability to apply as a representative. Another feature is the ability for a user to submit a full ranking of representative to allow him a larger ability to customize his vote. We also want to give representatives weights, to take account of the fact that some of them will receive more votes than their counterparts and therefore should have a larger mandate. Lastly the system should discourage tactical voting, as we want people to submit their real votes.
\\
For the negotiation and distribution of the budget, the beneficial characteristics are thus. Representatives can submit sources of expenditures and what their preferred budget is. During this pre negotiation phase all messages sent to each other is recorded and non repudiable, this should increase accountability. Then the system will run a automated negotiation algorithm, which solves the problem of representatives’ personality affecting the outcome. The negotiation algorithm should be deterministic and therefore others users can check the integrity of the budget. Again the algorithm should be difficult to manipulate by submitting a “fake preferred  budget”. Lastly for the distribution of the budget, after the negotiation the money should be sent automatically to the managers of the expenditures.
